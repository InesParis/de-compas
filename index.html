              de-compassجهت‌نایاب is a group exhibition that delves into the
              disorientation and alienation experienced within modern urban
              landscapes. In a world where societies are increasingly regulated
              and surveilled, individuals often find themselves lost amidst the
              bustling metropolis, navigating through cities prioritising
              vehicular convenience over human connection. Through a curated
              selection of artworks, de-compassجهت‌نایاب exposes the
              complexities of contemporary urban life, where perceptions of
              others are shaped not by personal interactions but by media
              portrayals and digital algorithms. The projects explore the
              concept of direction and control, prompting viewers to reflect on
              their position within complex urban settings and consider how
              societal structures influence personal autonomy and identity.

                  Experience the A100 Highway in Berlin through a series of
                  meticulously captured footage from both sides. Each frame,
                  frozen in time by an ultra-high camera shutter speed of 1/8000
                  sec, offers a glimpse into the relentless pace of the highway,
                  nearly imperceptible to the naked eye. Inspired by the
                  poignant question posed by city planners: “Do we envision a
                  city moving at pedestrian pace (5 km/h) or at the rapid speed
                  of vehicles (80 km/h)?”

                <p>
                  "Drift on the waves" project deals with the question of how
                  certain dominant narratives manifest themselves in culture and
                  how media works through hierarchical means of assigning value.
                  It explores connections between media use and the
                  associations, ideas, and images of different cultures.<br />

                  Music has no substance, no essence, no meaning in itself. It
                  arises from tones, intervals of tones, sequences of tones, and
                  pauses. All meaning is brought to it from the outside. Where
                  do images and associations to music come from? How are they
                  learned? And what role do the media play in this?

                <p>
                  The project is interested in city as a living organism — a
                  dynamic entity that consumes energy, produces waste, and is
                  interconnected through telecommunication and transport
                  networks. Unlike individual humans or animals, cities have
                  lifespans that extend far beyond ours, constantly evolving and
                  adapting to meet the needs of their citizens.<br />

                  Cities possess embedded memories within their fabric and,
                  although we can only imagine, there may exist a form of
                  consciousness within them. It's a symbiotic relationship: as
                  much as we design the city, it, in turn, designs and shapes
                  us. With over half of the global population residing in
                  cities, our habits, identities, and individual personalities
                  are moulded by these urban environments. Yet, each city has
                  its unique character and qualities that captivate us. It is
                  this fascination that drives us to explore and uncover the
                  distinct qualities of metropolises worldwide.
